 Save, then diagnose (copy-paste in Shell)
bash
Copy
Edit
# make sure you're at project root
pwd
git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo "Not in a git repo"

echo "== ROOT STATUS =="
git status -s

echo "== NESTED REPOS (.git folders besides root) =="
find . -type d -name .git -not -path "./.git" -printf "%h\n" || true

echo "== IGNORED? (client/server/public) =="
git check-ignore -v client server public 2>/dev/null || true

echo "== UNTRACKED FILES (first 50) =="
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | head -n 50

echo "== CURRENT BRANCH & REMOTE =="
git branch -vv
git remote -v
Interpret quickly:

If you see paths printed under NESTED REPOS (e.g. client, server), your changes are inside separate Git repos, so the root repo can’t see them.

If git check-ignore prints rules for your folders/files, they’re being ignored.

If git status -s shows nothing, and there are no nested repos, you either already committed or didn’t save.

2) Fix based on the cause
A) Nested repo(s) found (most common in Replit)
You probably cloned a template where client or server came with its own .git. Either commit inside each subrepo or flatten them into the root. Easiest is to flatten:

bash
Copy
Edit
# FLATTEN nested repos so root Git can track everything
for d in client server; do
  if [ -d "$d/.git" ]; then
    echo "Flattening $d ..."
    rm -rf "$d/.git"
  fi
done

# Now commit from the root
git add -A
git commit -m "Track client/server in root repo"
git push
If you actually want them as submodules, that’s different—say so and I’ll give the exact git submodule steps.

B) Files are ignored by .gitignore
See which rule is ignoring them, then either adjust .gitignore or force-add:

bash
Copy
Edit
# show why a file is ignored
git check-ignore -v client/components/BottomNav.tsx

# temporarily force add ignored files
git add -f client/components/BottomNav.tsx
git commit -m "Force add ignored file(s)"
git push
If whole folders (e.g., client/) are ignored in .gitignore, remove or refine that rule, then git add -A && git commit.

C) Index lock / wrong branch / unsaved files
bash
Copy
Edit
# clear any stale lock
rm -f .git/index.lock

# make sure you’re on main (or the branch you expect)
git branch --show-current
# if needed:
# git switch main 2>/dev/null || git switch -c main

# now commit again
git add -A
git commit -m "Commit pending work"
git push
Also confirm Replit “Auto-save” is on, or press Ctrl+S on changed files.

3) One-shot “do it for me” script (safe default)
This flattens nested repos if present, then commits everything from the root.

bash
Copy
Edit
set -e
rm -f .git/index.lock || true

# flatten nested repos if any
for d in $(find . -type d -name .git -not -path "./.git" -printf "%h\n"); do
  echo "Flattening nested repo at $d"
  rm -rf "$d/.git"
done

# stage, commit, push
git add -A
git commit -m "Commit workspace changes (flatten nested repos if any)" || echo "No changes to commit."
git push || true
4) If you still see “Nothing to commit”
You truly have no changes (everything already committed), or

You’re editing a different workspace folder than your Git root.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git log --oneline -5
If your recent work isn’t there, you edited files outside the repo Git is tracking. Move those files into the repo, then git add -A && git commit.
